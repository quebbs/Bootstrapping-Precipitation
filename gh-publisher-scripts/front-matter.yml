title: "An Applied Method for Synthetic Spatially Distributed Continuous Precipitation Development"
abstract: "Spatially distributed synthetic continuous precipitation requires the maintenance of
spatial and temporal correlations, in addition to seasonal variations of the distributions and correlative
structure. Here, we present a means of developing a unique synthetic precipitation series using an event-
based bootstrapping approach with distribution sampling and scaling."
