  Abstract                 = {The SNOW-17 snow accumulation and ablation model was first described by Anderson
[1973] as a component of the National Weather Service River Forecast System
(NWSRFS). SNOW-17 evolved from two earlier snow models [Anderson and Crawford
(1964) and Anderson (1968)]. A few minor changes and the addition of snow depth
computations have been made to the SNOW-17 model since 1973. This document
describes the current version of SNOW-17. Besides just describing the model, this
document also provides some insights into the reasoning and logic used by the author in
developing the model. Hopefully this information will be helpful to future users.},

  Title                    = {An Ensemble Adjustment Kalman Filter for Data Assimilation},

  Journal                  = {Monthly Weather Review},
  Year                     = {2001},

  Abstract                 = {A theory for estimating the probability distribution of the state of a model given a set of observations exists.
This nonlinear filtering theory unifies the data assimilation and ensemble generation problem that have been
key foci of prediction and predictability research for numerical weather and ocean prediction applications. A
new algorithm, referred to as an ensemble adjustment Kalman filter, and the more traditional implementation
of the ensemble Kalman filter in which ‘‘perturbed observations’’ are used, are derived as Monte Carlo approximations to the nonlinear filter. Both ensemble Kalman filter methods produce assimilations with small
ensemble mean errors while providing reasonable measures of uncertainty in the assimilated variables. The
ensemble methods can assimilate observations with a nonlinear relation to model state variables and can also
use observations to estimate the value of imprecisely known model parameters. These ensemble filter methods
are shown to have significant advantages over four-dimensional variational assimilation in low-order models
and scale easily to much larger applications. Heuristic modifications to the filtering algorithms allow them to
be applied efficiently to very large models by sequentially processing observations and computing the impact
of each observation on each state variable in an independent calculation. The ensemble adjustment Kalman filter
is applied to a nondivergent barotropic model on the sphere to demonstrate the capabilities of the filters in
models with state spaces that are much larger than the ensemble size.
When observations are assimilated in the traditional ensemble Kalman filter, the resulting updated ensemble
has a mean that is consistent with the value given by filtering theory, but only the expected value of the covariance
of the updated ensemble is consistent with the theory. The ensemble adjustment Kalman filter computes a linear
operator that is applied to the prior ensemble estimate of the state, resulting in an updated ensemble whose
mean and also covariance are consistent with the theory. In the cases compared here, the ensemble adjustment
Kalman filter performs significantly better than the traditional ensemble Kalman filter, apparently because noise
introduced into the assimilated ensemble through perturbed observations in the traditional filter limits its relative
performance. This superior performance may not occur for all problems and is expected to be most notable for
small ensembles. Still, the results suggest that careful study of the capabilities of different varieties of ensemble
Kalman filters is appropriate when exploring new applications.},

  Abstract                 = {The term flashiness reflects the frequency and rapidity of short term changes in streamflow, especially during runoff
events. Flashiness is an important component of a stream’s hydrologic regime. A variety of land use and land management changes
may lead to increased or decreased flashiness, often to the detriment of aquatic life. This paper presents a newly developed flashiness index, which is based on mean daily flows. The index is calculated by dividing the pathlength of flow oscillations for a time
interval (i.e., the sum of the absolute values of day-to-day changes
in mean daily flow) by total discharge during that time interval.
This index has low interannual variability, relative to most flow
regime indicators, and thus greater power to detect trends. Index
values were calculated for 515 Midwestern streams for the 27-year
period from 1975 through 2001. Statistically significant increases
were present in 22 percent of the streams, primarily in the eastern
portion of the study area, while decreases were present in 9 percent, primarily in the western portion. Index values tend to
decrease with increasing watershed area and with increasing unit
area ground water inputs. Area compensated index values often
shift at ecoregion boundaries. Potential index applications include
evaluation of programs to restore more natural flow regimes.

  Abstract                 = {Long, high time resolution precipitation time series are often needed in hydrology. In most cases available measurements are not sufficient, because of a coarse time resolution and/or because observations are taken at differing locations. Often generated time series are used. These series are usually obtained from stochastic precipitation models that reproduce properties of the observed series. The purpose of this paper is to present a different methodology, one in which precipitation series can be generated by directly using their properties. The method uses simulated annealing, based on the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. An objective function including all desired properties is formulated. The method generates series with the desired properties. The advantage of this formulation is that properties of the precipitation that are important for the target application can directly be incorporated. The method can also be applied for generating precipitation series in a changed climate. For this purpose, changes of the statistical properties of the series have to be assessed.},

amounts together with the rainfall occurrences in one relationship.
The second is in the evaluation of the (necessary
but often ignored) congregating behaviour of the higher values
of simulated rainfall; this evaluation is performed by calculating
the entropy of the observations at all the near equilateral
triangles that can be formed from the sequences at the
gauge sites, as a function of their mutual separation distance.
It turns out that the model captures the qualities desired and
offers a fresh approach to a relatively mature problem in hydrometeorology.},

Two versions of the resampling method, conditional on the atmospheric circulation and unconditional, show comparable results. For precipitation, the autocorrelation properties are well reproduced, whereas for temperature the autocorrelation coefficients are systematically underpredicted. The distributions of the N -day annual maximum precipitation amounts are adequately preserved. Despite the systematic underprediction of the temperature autocorrelation, the distributions of N -day maximum snowmelt are well reproduced.

  Abstract                 = {The method of nearest-neighbor resampling is extended to simultaneous simulation of daily precipitation and temperature at multiple locations over a large area (25 stations in the German part of the Rhine basin). Nearest neighbors refer here to historical days for which the observed weather is closest to that of the simulated weather for a given day. Resampling is done from these nearest neighbors to obtain the weather variables for the next day. The nearest neighbors are defined in terms of a weighted Euclidean distance to a feature vector containing summary statistics of the daily precipitation and temperature fields (spatial averages, fraction of stations with precipitation, and principal components). The inclusion of atmospheric circulation variables in the feature vector is also studied. There is a weak tendency to underestimate the standard deviations and autocorrelation coefficients of daily precipitation and temperature and the standard deviations of the monthly precipitation totals and monthly mean temperatures. However, the underprediction of these second-order moment statistics is not statistically significant if the number k of nearest neighbors in the resampling procedure is small (k ≈ 5) and the dimension q of the feature vector is low (q ≈ 3). A small systematic underprediction is also observed for the quantiles of the distributions of the N-day winter maximum precipitation amounts. The spatial dependence of these extremes and the distributions of N-day maximum snowmelt are adequately reproduced. Long-duration simulations show that realistic unprecedented multiday precipitation amounts can be generated.},

  Abstract                 = {Although being one of the most popular and extensively studied approaches to
design water reservoir operations, Stochastic Dynamic Programming is plagued by a dual
curse that makes it unsuitable to cope with large water systems: the computational
requirement grows exponentially with the number of state variables considered (curse of
dimensionality) and an explicit model must be available to describe every system transition
and the associated rewards/costs (curse of modeling). A variety of simplifications and
approximations have been devised in the past, which, in many cases, make the resulting
operating policies inefficient and of scarce relevance in practical contexts. In this paper, a
reinforcement‐learning approach, called fitted Q‐iteration, is presented: it combines the
principle of continuous approximation of the value functions with a process of learning
off‐line from experience to design daily, cyclostationary operating policies. The
continuous approximation, performed via tree‐based regression, makes it possible to
mitigate the curse of dimensionality by adopting a very coarse discretization grid with
respect to the dense grid required to design an equally performing policy via Stochastic
Dynamic Programming. The learning experience, in the form of a data set generated
combining historical observations and model simulations, allows us to overcome the curse
of modeling. Lake Como water system (Italy) is used as study site to infer general
guidelines on the appropriate setting for the algorithm parameters and to demonstrate the
advantages of the approach in terms of accuracy and computational effectiveness
compared to traditional Stochastic Dynamic Programming.},

  Abstract                 = {In the early 1990s a cluster of extreme flood events occurred in the south Galway region of western Ireland, and this led to speculation of changing rainfall patterns in the area. In this paper we illustrate the use of generalized linear models (GLMs) to test for such changes and quantify their structure. GLMs, long established in the statistical literature, provide a flexible and rigorous formal framework within which to distinguish between possible climate change scenarios and are able to deal with high levels of variability, such as those typically associated with daily rainfall sequences. The study indicates that the GLM approach provides a powerful tool for interpreting historical rainfall records.},

implementation of the EnKF is inappropriate because of non-linear relationships between model states
and observations. Transforming streamflow into log space before computing error covariances improves
filter performance. We also demonstrate that model simulations improve when we use a variant of the
EnKF that does not require perturbed observations. Our attempt to propagate information to neighbouring basins was unsuccessful, largely due to inadequacies in modelling the spatial variability of hydrological processes. New methods are needed to produce ensemble simulations that both reflect total model
error and adequately simulate the spatial variability of hydrological states and fluxes.},

These properties are that any quantile estimate made from the plot should be unbiased and should have smallest mean square error among all such estimates. This leads to specification of plotting position initially in terms of reduced variate rather than probability value. The unbiased plotting position is E(y(i)), the mean of the ith order statistic in samples from the reduced variate population, which differs from one distribution to another. A good approximation for each distribution is available in the probability domain. These take the general form (i − α)(N + 1 − 2α) with α = 38 in the normal case and α = 0.44 in the extreme-value type-1 (EV1) and exponential cases. The Weibull formula, α = 0, is correct for the uniform distribution alone and is shown to be biased for other distributions. Hazen's formula α = 12 shows up much better in terms of bias than many would expect. If a single simple distribution free formula were required then α = 25 would be the best compromise. The plotting position postulates which have supported the Weibull formula for many years are examined and some are seen to be unreasonable in view of statistical facts.},

and in-line storage in combined sewer systems is challenging due to the need for complex optimization models integrated with urban stormwater
runoff prediction and fully dynamic routing of sewer flows within 5e15 min computational time increments. A neural-optimal control algorithm
is presented that fully incorporates the complexities of dynamic, unsteady hydraulic modeling of combined sewer system flows and optimal
coordinated, system-wide regulation of in-line storage. The neural-optimal control module is based on a recurrent Jordan neural network architecture that is trained using optimal policies produced by a dynamic optimal control module. The neural-optimal control algorithm is demonstrated in a simulated real-time control experiment for the King County combined sewer system, Seattle, Washington, USA. The algorithm
exhibits an effective adaptive learning capability that results in near-optimal performance of the control system while satisfying the time constraints of real-time implementation.},

In this paper, we suggest a non-dominated sorting-based MOEA, called NSGA-II (Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II), which alleviates all of the above three difficulties. Specifically, a fast non-dominated sorting approach with O(MN2) computational complexity is presented. Also, a selection operator is presented that creates a mating pool by combining the parent and offspring populations and selecting the best N solutions (with respect to fitness and spread). Simulation results on difficult test problems show that NSGA-II is able, for most problems, to find a much better spread of solutions and better convergence near the true Pareto-optimal front compared to the Pareto-archived evolution strategy and the strength-Pareto evolutionary algorithm - two other elitist MOEAs that pay special attention to creating a diverse Pareto-optimal front. Moreover, we modify the definition of dominance in order to solve constrained multi-objective problems efficiently. Simulation results of the constrained NSGA-II on a number of test problems, including a five-objective, seven-constraint nonlinear problem, are compared with another constrained multi-objective optimizer, and the much better performance of NSGA-II is observed},

new ideas and alternative interpretations which further
explain the success of the EnKF. In addition to providing the theoretical framework needed for using the
EnKF, there is also a focus on the algorithmic formulation and optimal numerical implementation. A
program listing is given for some of the key subroutines. The paper also touches upon specific issues such
as the use of nonlinear measurements, in situ profiles
of temperature and salinity, and data which are
available with high frequency in time. An ensemble based optimal interpolation (EnOI) scheme is
presented as a cost-effective approach which may serve
as an alternative to the EnKF in some applications. A
fairly extensive discussion is devoted to the use of time
correlated model errors and the estimation of model
bias.},

results reveal that the largest fraction of predictable variance
for both temperature and precipitation occur mainly over
the tropics where El Niño/Southern Oscillation dominates
the interannual variability. Statistically significant potential
predictability also is found in extratropics for temperature,
particularly over most oceans and appreciable land areas.
The potential predictability of temperature is generally smaller
over land than over ocean and displays a significant annual
cycle. Potential predictability of precipitation displays spotty
and less continuous spatial patterns over extratropical regions
and also undergoes a significant annual cycle. The potential
predictability estimates are generally consistent with previous
studies, but some inconsistency is also observed, such as the
lack of significant potential predictability for temperature over
North American winter},

  Abstract                 = {Many forest management planning decisions are based on information about the number of trees by species and diameter per unit area. This information is commonly summarized in a stand table, where a stand is defined as a group of forest trees of sufficiently uniform species composition, age, condition, or productivity to be considered a homogeneous unit for planning purposes. Typically, information used to construct stand tables is gleaned from observed subsets of the forest selected using a probability-based sampling design. Such sampling campaigns are expensive, and hence, only a small number of sample units are typically observed. This data paucity means that stand tables can only be estimated for relatively large areal units. Contemporary forest management planning and spatially explicit ecosystem models require stand table input at higher spatial resolution than can be affordably provided using traditional approaches. We propose a dynamic multivariate Poisson spatial regression model that accommodates both spatial correlation between observed diameter distributions and also correlation between tree counts across diameter classes within each location. To improve fit and prediction at unobserved locations, diameter specific intensities can be estimated using auxiliary data such as management history or remotely sensed information. The proposed model is used to analyze a diverse forest inventory dataset collected on the United States Forest Service Penobscot Experimental Forest in Bradley, Maine. Results demonstrate that explicitly modeling the residual spatial structure via a multivariate Gaussian process and incorporating information about forest structure from Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) covariates improve model fit and can provide high spatial resolution stand table maps with associated estimates of uncertainty.

Our methods are simple and generally applicable to the output of any iterative simulation; they are designed for researchers primarily interested in the science underlying the data and models they are analyzing, rather than for researchers interested in the probability theory underlying the iterative simulations themselves. Our recommended strategy is to use several independent sequences, with starting points sampled from an overdispersed distribution. At each step of the iterative simulation, we obtain, for each univariate estimand of interest, a distributional estimate and an estimate of how much sharper the distributional estimate might become if the simulations were continued indefinitely. Because our focus is on applied inference for Bayesian posterior distributions in real problems, which often tend toward normality after transformations and marginalization, we derive our results as normal-theory approximations to exact Bayesian inference, conditional on the observed simulations. The methods are illustrated on a random-effects mixture model applied to experimental measurements of reaction times of normal and schizophrenic patients.},

Here, we present a diagnostically interesting decomposition of NSE (and hence MSE), which facilitates
analysis of the relative importance of its different components in the context of hydrological modelling,

analysis is illustrated by calibrating a simple conceptual precipitation-runoff model to daily data for a
number of Austrian basins having a broad range of hydro-meteorological characteristics. Evaluation of
the results clearly demonstrates the problems that can be associated with any calibration based on the
NSE (or MSE) criterion. While we propose and test an alternative criterion that can help to reduce model
calibration problems, the primary purpose of this study is not to present an improved measure of model
performance. Instead, we seek to show that there are systematic problems inherent with any optimization
based on formulations related to the MSE. The analysis and results have implications to the manner
in which we calibrate and evaluate environmental models; we discuss these and suggest possible ways
forward that may move us towards an improved and diagnostically meaningful approach to model performance
evaluation and identification.},

  Abstract                 = {For derived flood frequency analysis based on hydrological modelling long continuous precipitation time series with high temporal resolution are needed. Often, the observation network with recording rainfall gauges is poor, especially regarding the limited length of the available rainfall time series. Stochastic precipitation synthesis is a good alternative either to extend or to regionalise rainfall series to provide adequate input for long-term rainfall-runoff modelling with subsequent estimation of design floods. Here, a new two step procedure for stochastic synthesis of continuous hourly space-time rainfall is proposed and tested for the extension of short observed precipitation time series. 

First, a single-site alternating renewal model is presented to simulate independent hourly precipitation time series for several locations. The alternating renewal model describes wet spell durations, dry spell durations and wet spell intensities using univariate frequency distributions separately for two seasons. The dependence between wet spell intensity and duration is accounted for by 2-copulas. For disaggregation of the wet spells into hourly intensities a predefined profile is used. In the second step a multi-site resampling procedure is applied on the synthetic point rainfall event series to reproduce the spatial dependence structure of rainfall. Resampling is carried out successively on all synthetic event series using simulated annealing with an objective function considering three bivariate spatial rainfall characteristics. In a case study synthetic precipitation is generated for some locations with short observation records in two mesoscale catchments of the Bode river basin located in northern Germany. The synthetic rainfall data are then applied for derived flood frequency analysis using the hydrological model HEC-HMS. The results show good performance in reproducing average and extreme rainfall characteristics as well as in reproducing observed flood frequencies. The presented model has the potential to be used for ungauged locations through regionalisation of the model parameters.},

evaluating these approximations is addressed. Such evaluations are useful when performing
experimental comparisons of different multiple objective heuristic algorithms, when defining
stopping rules of multiple objective heuristic algorithms, and when adjusting parameters of
heuristic algorithms to a given problem. A family of outperformance relations that can be used
to compare approximations under very weak assumptions about a decision-maker’s
preferences is introduced. These outperformance relations define incomplete orders in the set
of all approximations. It is shown that in order to compare approximations, which are
incomparable according to the outperformance relations, much stronger assumptions about the
decision-maker's preferences are necessary. A general framework that can be used to compare
and evaluate approximations under the presence of various types of additional information is
proposed. Some particular comparison and evaluation methods based on this framework are

conventional moments is that L-moments, being linear functions of the data, suffer less
from the effects of sampling variability: L-moments are more robust than conventional
moments to outliers in the data and enable more secure inferences to be made from small
samples about an underlying probability distribution. L-moments sometimes yield more

  Abstract                 = {An ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) has been implemented at the Canadian Meteorological Centre to provide
an ensemble of initial conditions for the medium-range ensemble prediction system. This demonstrates that the
EnKF can be used for operational atmospheric data assimilation.
We show how the EnKF relates to the Kalman filter. In particular, to make the ensemble approximation
feasible, we have to use a fairly small ensemble with many less members than either the number of model
coordinates, or the number of independent observations, or the (unknown) dimension of the dynamical system.
To nevertheless obtain good results, we must (i) counter the tendency of the ensemble spread to underestimate
the true error, and (ii) localize the ensemble covariances. The localization is severe and leads to imbalance in the
initial conditions.
The operational EnKF is used to investigate to what extent our system respects the underlying hypotheses
of both the Kalman filter and its ensemble approximation. In particular, we quantify the imbalance in the initial
conditions and the magnitude of the model-error component. The occurrence of imbalance constrains the ways in
which time interpolation can be performed and in which parametrized model error can be added. With this study
we hope to obtain and provide guidance for further improvements to the EnKF.b},

improve SWE predictions, we introduce a spatio-temporal model that incorporates the SWE data

  Abstract                 = {A stochastic model for the generation of daily time series of rainfall at multiple locations in which the amount of daily rainfall is modeled by a mixture of two different probability distribution functions is presented. A mixture model is implemented with the specific objective of characterizing extremes of daily precipitation. The approach is based on the assumption that the extremes within a time series have a different stochastic behavior compared to the normal regime of precipitation. A multivariate autoregressive model is used to model the local probability of occurrence of rainfall and the amount while keeping the intersite covariance structure using a truncated normal distribution. The amount simulated using the truncated normal distribution is further transformed so that it can be regarded as coming from the actual distribution fitted to the daily precipitation at each station using the probability integral transformation. The seasonal cycles of the amount as well as the temporal and spatial correlations of the daily precipitation are incorporated by fitting the model on the monthly basis. Application was made on 122 stations within the Unstrut catchment with an area of 6343 km2 in central eastern Germany. Results show that the model can fairly well reproduce a number of statistical features of daily precipitation including the extreme value distribution of the annual maximum daily and 3 day total precipitation, both at individual stations and at the catchment scale.},

of the system together with a model for the system’s time evolution. Rather than solving the problem from scratch each time new observations
become available, one uses the model to “forecast” the current state, using a prior state estimate (which incorporates information from past data) as
the initial condition, then uses current data to correct the prior forecast to a current state estimate. This Bayesian approach is most effective when
the uncertainty in both the observations and in the state estimate, as it evolves over time, are accurately quantified. In this article, we describe a
practical method for data assimilation in large, spatiotemporally chaotic systems. The method is a type of “ensemble Kalman filter”, in which the
state estimate and its approximate uncertainty are represented at any given time by an ensemble of system states. We discuss both the mathematical
basis of this approach and its implementation; our primary emphasis is on ease of use and computational speed rather than improving accuracy
over previously published approaches to ensemble Kalman filtering. We include some numerical results demonstrating the efficiency and accuracy
of our implementation for assimilating real atmospheric data with the global forecast model used by the US National Weather Service.},

reliability of water supplies, using simulations that utilize a single best estimate of
distributions of data to evaluate performance. However, the estimates of problem
information and likelihoods could be incorrect, especially when planning for climate
change, which can modify streamflow availability, or projecting the trajectories of
future water demands. These conditions are termed deep uncertainty, in which
decision makers cannot fully conceptualize or agree upon the full range of risks to
their system. This presentation will advance a new interactive framework that
combines robust decision making (RDM) with many-objective optimization using
evolutionary algorithms (MOEA) to confront deep uncertainty for water planning.
The framework is demonstrated using a case study that examines a single city's
water supply in the Lower Rio Grande Valley (LRGV) in Texas, USA. We use a
MOEA to develop a tradeoff set of water supply portfolios for the LRGV, and
develop a suite of values for key uncertainties using RDM that represent an
ensemble of “states of the world”. Each solution is tested under the ensemble of
plausible future states of the world, with interactive visualizations being used to
identify robust solutions for the system. Scenario discovery methods that use
statistical data mining algorithms are then used to identify what assumptions and
system conditions strongly control the cost-effectiveness, efficiency, and reliability
of the robust alternatives. The results suggest that combining robust decision
making, many-objective optimization, and visual analytics can dramatically improve
risk-based planning decisions.},

  Abstract                 = {This thesis focuses on optimization techniques for multi-reservoir hydropower
systems operation, with a particular concern with the representation and impact of
uncertainty. The thesis reports on three research investigations: 1) examination of the
impact of uncertainty representations, 2) efficient solution methods for multi-reservoir
stochastic dynamic programming (SDP) models, and 3) diagnostic analyses for
hydropower system operation.
The first investigation explores the value of sophistication in the representation
of forecast and inflow uncertainty in stochastic hydropower optimization models using
a sampling SDP (SSDP) model framework. SSDP models with different uncertainty
representation ranging in sophistication from simple deterministic to complex dynamic
stochastic models are employed when optimize a single reservoir systems [similar to
Faber and Stedinger, 2001]. The effect of uncertainty representation on simulated
system performance is examined with varying storage and powerhouse capacity, and
with random or mean energy prices. In many cases very simple uncertainty models
perform as well as more complex ones, but not always.
The second investigation develops a new and efficient algorithm for solving
multi-reservoir SDP models: Corridor SDP. Rather than employing a uniform grid
across the entire state space, Corridor SDP efficiently concentrates points in where the
system is likely to visit, as determined by historical operations or simulation. Radial
basis functions (RBFs) are used for interpolation. A greedy algorithm places points
where they are needed to achieve a good approximation. In a four-reservoir test case,
Corridor DP achieves the same accuracy as spline-DP and linear-DP with
approximately 1/10 and 1/1100 the number of discrete points, respectively. When
local curvature is more pronounced (due to minimum-flow constraints), Corridor DP
achieves the same accuracy as spline-DP and linear-DP with approximately 1/30 and
1/215 the number of points, respectively.
The third investigation explores three diagnostic approaches for analyzing
hydropower system operation. First, several simple diagnostic statistics describe
reservoir volume and powerhouse capacity in units of time, allowing scale-invariant
comparisons and classification of different reservoir systems and their operation.
Second, a regression analysis using optimal storage/release sequences identifies the
most useful hydrologic state variables . Finally spectral density estimation identifies
critical time scales for operation for several single-reservoir systems considering mean
and random energy prices.
Deregulation of energy markets has made optimization of hydropower
operations an active concern. Another development is publication of Extended
Streamflow Forecasts (ESP) by the National Weather Service (NWS) and others to
describe flow forecasts and their precision; the multivariate Sampling SDP models
employed here are appropriately structured to incorporate such information in
operational hydropower decisions. This research contributes to our ability to structure
and build effective hydropower optimization models.},

  Abstract                 = {Although several variants of stochastic dynamic programming have been applied to optimal operation of multireservoir systems, they have been plagued by a high-dimensional state space and the inability to accurately incorporate the stochastic environment as characterized by temporally and spatially correlated hydrologic inflows. Reinforcement learning has emerged as an effective approach to solving sequential decision problems by combining concepts from artificial intelligence, cognitive science, and operations research. A reinforcement learning system has a mathematical foundation similar to dynamic programming and Markov decision processes, with the goal of maximizing the long-term reward or returns as conditioned on the state of the system environment and the immediate reward obtained from operational decisions. Reinforcement learning can include Monte Carlo simulation where transition probabilities and rewards are not explicitly known a priori. The Q-Learning method in reinforcement learning is demonstrated on the two-reservoir Geum River system, South Korea, and is shown to outperform implicit stochastic dynamic programming and sampling stochastic dynamic programming methods.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents a comparison of three multi-site stochastic weather generators for simulation of point rainfall occurrences at a network of 30 raingauge stations around Sydney, Australia. The approaches considered include a parametric hidden Markov model (HMM), a multi-site stochastic precipitation generation model (proposed by [Wilks, D.S., 1998. Multisite generalization of a daily stochastic precipitation model, J. Hydrol. 210, 178–191.]) and a non-parametric K-nearest neighbour (KNN) model. The HMM generates the precipitation distribution conditional on a discrete weather state representing certain identified spatial rainfall distribution patterns. The spatial dependence is maintained by assumption of a common weather state across all stations while the temporal dependence is simulated by assuming the weather state to be Markovian in nature. The Wilks model preserves serial dependence through the assumption of an order one Markov dependence at each location. The spatial dependence is simulated by prescribing a dependence pattern on the uniform random variates used to generate the rainfall occurrence at each location from the associated conditional probability distribution. The K-nearest neighbour approach simulates spatial dependence by simultaneously generating precipitation occurrence at all locations. Temporal persistence is simulated through Markovian assumptions on the rainfall occurrence process. The three methods are evaluated for their ability to model spatial and temporal dependence in the rainfall occurrence field and also the relative ease with which the assumptions of spatial and temporal dependence can be accommodated. Our results indicate that all the approaches are successful in reproducing spatial dependence in the multi-site rainfall occurrence field. However, the different orders of assumed Markovian dependence in the observed data limit their ability in representing temporal dependence at time scales longer than a few days. While each approach comes with its own advantages and disadvantages, the alternative proposed by Wilks has an overall advantage in offering a mechanism for modelling varying orders of serial dependence at each point location, while still maintaining the observed spatial dependence with sufficient accuracy.},

  Abstract                 = {The traditional and still prevailing approach to
characterization of flood hazards to dams is the inflow
design flood (IDF). The IDF, defined either deterministically or probabilistically, is necessary for sizing a dam, its
discharge facilities and reservoir storage. However, within
the dam safety risk informed decision framework, the IDF
does not carry much relevance, no matter how accurately it
is characterized. In many cases, the probability of the
reservoir inflow tells us little about the probability of dam
overtopping. Typically, the reservoir inflow and its associated probability of occurrence is modified by the interplay of a number of factors (reservoir storage, reservoir
operating rules and various operational faults and natural
disturbances) on its way to becoming the reservoir outflow
and corresponding peak level—the two parameters that
represent hydrologic hazard acting upon the dam. To
properly manage flood risk, it is essential to change approach to flood hazard analysis for dam safety from the
currently prevailing focus on reservoir inflows and instead
focus on reservoir outflows and corresponding reservoir
levels. To demonstrate these points, this paper presents
stochastic simulation of floods on a cascade system of three
dams and shows progression from exceedance probabilities
of reservoir inflow to exceedance probabilities of peak
reservoir level depending on initial reservoir level, storage
availability, reservoir operating rules and availability of
discharge facilities on demand. The results show that the
dam overtopping is more likely to be caused by a combination of a smaller flood and a system component failure
than by an extreme flood on its own.},

The climate response function was then used to evaluate system performance over a wide range of climate conditions and to define robustness indicators. The robustness indicators, which measure system performance as a function of climate state, are conditioned on explicit assumptions about climate variable probability distributions. To illustrate this process, it is applied to the upper Great Lakes to evaluate system robustness related to water management decisions and assess the impact of climate probability assumptions. The robustness indicators were used to identify decisions that outperformed other courses of action regardless of assumptions of future climate probabilities.},

  Abstract                 = {Climate change is believed to pose potential risks to the stakeholders of the Great Lakes due to changes in lake levels. This paper presents a model of stakeholder-defined risk as a function of climate change. It describes the development of a statistical model that links water resources system performance and climate changes developed for the Great Lakes of North America. The function is used in a process that links bottom-up water system vulnerability assessment to top-down climate change information. Vulnerabilities are defined based on input from stakeholders and resource experts and are used to determine system performance thresholds. These thresholds are used to measure performance over a wide range of climate changes mined from a large (55,590 year) stochastic data set. The performance and climate conditions are used to create a climate response function, a statistical model to predict lake performance based on climate statistics. This function facilitates exploration and analysis of performance over a wide range of climate conditions. It can also be used to estimate risk associated with change in climate mean and variability resulting from climate change. Problematic changes in climate can be identified and the probability of those conditions estimated using climate projections or other sources of climate information. The function can also be used to evaluate the robustness of a regulation plan and to compare performance of alternate plans. This paper demonstrates the utility of the climate response function as applied within the context of the International Upper Great Lakes Study.},

latter, which modelers use to predict, for example, streamflow at some future time given knowledge of the current state of the system
and model parameters. In this respect, good estimates of the parameters and state variables are needed to enable the model to generate accurate forecasts. In this paper, a dual state–parameter estimation approach is presented based on the Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) for sequential estimation of both parameters and state variables of a hydrologic model. A systematic approach for
identification of the perturbation factors used for ensemble generation and for selection of ensemble size is discussed. The dual
EnKF methodology introduces a number of novel features: (1) both model states and parameters can be estimated simultaneously;
(2) the algorithm is recursive and therefore does not require storage of all past information, as is the case in the batch calibration
procedures; and (3) the various sources of uncertainties can be properly addressed, including input, output, and parameter uncertainties. The applicability and usefulness of the dual EnKF approach for ensemble streamflow forecasting is demonstrated using a
conceptual rainfall-runoff model.},

The T changes tend to agree more across downscaling techniques than the P changes. Year-to-year natural internal climate variability is roughly of similar magnitude to the projected T changes. In the monthly average, July temperatures shift enough that that the hottest July found in any simulation over the historical period becomes a modestly cool July in the future period. Januarys as cold as any found in the historical period are still found in the 2060s, but the median and maximum monthly average temperatures increase notably. Annual and seasonal P changes are small compared to interannual or intermodel variability. However, the annual change is composed of seasonally varying changes that are themselves much larger, but tend to cancel in the annual mean. Winters show modestly wetter conditions in the North of the state, while spring and autumn show less precipitation. The dynamical downscaling techniques project increasing precipitation in the Southeastern part of the state, which is influenced by the North American monsoon, a feature that is not captured by the statistical downscaling.},

  Abstract                 = {Hydrologic models are commonly calibrated by optimizing a single objective function target to compare simulated and observed flows, although individual targets are influenced by specific flow modes. Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) emphasizes flood peaks in evaluating simulation fit, while modified Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (MNS) emphasizes lower flows, and the ratio of the simulated to observed standard deviations (RSD) prioritizes flow variability. We investigated tradeoffs of calibrating streamflow on three standard objective functions (NSE, MNS, and RSD), as well as a multiobjective function aggregating these three targets to simultaneously address a range of flow conditions, for calibration of the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) daily streamflow simulations in two watersheds. A suite of objective functions was explored to select a minimally redundant set of metrics addressing a range of flow characteristics. After each pass of 2001 simulations, an iterative informal likelihood procedure was used to subset parameter ranges. The ranges from each best-fit simulation set were used for model validation. Values for optimized parameters vary among calibrations using different objective functions, which underscores the importance of linking modeling objectives to calibration target selection. The simulation set approach yielded validated models of similar quality as seen with a single best-fit parameter set, with the added benefit of uncertainty estimations. Our approach represents a novel compromise between equifinality-based approaches and Pareto optimization. Combining the simulation set approach with the multiobjective function was demonstrated to be a practicable and flexible approach for model calibration, which can be readily modified to suit modeling goals, and is not model or location specific.},

It does not require prior assumptions as to the form of the joint probability density function of the variables. An application of the resampling scheme with 30 years of daily weather data at Salt Lake City, Utah, is provided.

assimilation are sensitive to observation and model error variances and, for very poor input
error parameters, may even be worse than model estimates without data assimilation.
Estimates of surface heat fluxes and runoff are at best marginally improved through the
assimilation of surface soil moisture and tend to have large errors when the assimilation
system operates with poor input error parameters. We present a computationally
affordable, adaptive assimilation system that continually adjusts model and observation
error parameters in response to internal diagnostics. The adaptive filter can identify model
and observation error variances and provide generally improved assimilation estimates
when compared to the non-adaptive system.},

  Abstract                 = {Soil moisture controls the partitioning of moisture and energy fluxes at the land surface and is a key variable
in weather and climate prediction. The performance of the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) for soil moisture
estimation is assessed by assimilating L-band (1.4 GHz) microwave radiobrightness observations into a land
surface model. An optimal smoother (a dynamic variational method) is used as a benchmark for evaluating the
filter’s performance. In a series of synthetic experiments the effect of ensemble size and non-Gaussian forecast
errors on the estimation accuracy of the EnKF is investigated. With a state vector dimension of 4608 and a
relatively small ensemble size of 30 (or 100; or 500), the actual errors in surface soil moisture at the final update
time are reduced by 55% (or 70%; or 80%) from the value obtained without assimilation (as compared to 84%
for the optimal smoother). For robust error variance estimates, an ensemble of at least 500 members is needed.
The dynamic evolution of the estimation error variances is dominated by wetting and drying events with high
variances during drydown and low variances when the soil is either very wet or very dry. Furthermore, the
ensemble distribution of soil moisture is typically symmetric except under very dry or wet conditions when the
effects of the nonlinearities in the model become significant. As a result, the actual errors are consistently larger
than ensemble-derived forecast and analysis error variances. This suggests that the update is suboptimal. However,
the degree of suboptimality is relatively small and results presented here indicate that the EnKF is a flexible
and robust data assimilation option that gives satisfactory estimates even for moderate ensemble sizes.},

  Abstract                 = {The requirements for hydrological models have increased considerably during the
previous decades to cope with the resolution of extensive remotely sensed data sets and a
number of demanding applications. Existing models exhibit deficiencies such as
overparameterization, the lack of an effective technique to integrate the spatial
heterogeneity of physiographic characteristics, and the nontransferability of parameters
across scales and locations. A multiscale parameter regionalization (MPR) technique is
proposed as a way to address these issues simultaneously. Using this technique, parameters
at a coarser scale, in which the dominant hydrological processes are represented, are
linked with their corresponding ones at a finer resolution in which input data sets are
available. The linkage is done with upscaling operators such as the harmonic mean, among
others. Parameters at the finer scale are regionalized through nonlinear transfer functions
which link basin predictors with global parameters to be determined through calibration.
MPR was compared with a standard regionalization (SR) method in which basin predictors
instead of model parameters are first aggregated. Both methods were tested in a basin
located in Germany using a distributed hydrologic model. Results indicate that MPR is
superior to SR in many respects, especially if global parameters are transferred from
coarser to finer scales. Furthermore, MPR, as opposed to SR, preserves the spatial
variability of state variables and conserves the mass balance with respect to a control scale.
Cross-validation tests indicate that the transferability of the global parameters to ungauged
locations is possible.},

n • then there exists an n-dimensional copula C (which is
unique when Fl •••••Fn are continuous) such that H(xl ••••• xn) =
C(Fl(xl) •••••Fn(xn)). During the years 1959 - 1974. most results concerning copulas were obtained in the course of the development of the
theory of probabilistic metric spaces. principally in connection with
the study of families of binary operations on the space of probability
distribution functions. Then it was discovered that two-dimensional
copulas could be used to define nonparametric measures of dependence
for pairs of random variables. In the ensuing years the copula concept
was rediscovered on several occasions and these functions began to play
an ever-more-important role in mathematical statistics. particularly in
matters involving questions of dependence. fixed marginals and functions
of random variables that are invariant under monotone transformations.
Today. in view of the fact that they are the higher dimensional analogues of uniform distributions on the unit interval. and as the result
of the efforts of a diverse group of scholars. the significance. ubiquity and utility of copulas is being recognized. This paper is devoted

  Abstract                 = {For over a century reservoirs have been used to buffer for hydrologic variability and
increase utilization of water resources. Reservoirs are generally operated using a set of written or
unwritten rules and procedures that modify the rate of release and/or diversion from a reservoir
based on the current state of the water supply system and its environment in order to achieve one
or more objectives. Tools and techniques have been developed to help create operating rules that
provide the desired mix of benefits to the extent possible for often competing objectives. This
project pulls together existing approaches to provide a thorough guide for reservoir operation
development.
This guide is a portion of a larger report titled Dynamic Reservoir Operations: Managing
for Climate Variability and Change also published by the Water Research Foundation. Dynamic
Reservoir Operations (DRO) are operating rules that change based on the present state of a system,
such as storage levels, current inflow, and/or forecasted conditions. Dynamic operations tend to
be effective because they depend on a diverse group of variables that result in a more robust
operational framework, providing utilities more information for operating their system to meet
objectives under varying conditions. The primary objectives of the full project were 1) to
demonstrate the potential value of dynamic reservoir operations in improving system reliability,
resilience, and performance under challenging climate conditions and 2) to provide utilities with
practical guidance to decide if and how to implement DRO. The Reservoir Operations
Development Guide was created to help meet the second objective.
This guide includes rule forms that address different management objectives and step-bystep guidelines for developing effective rules. Developing DRO is not a cookie-cutter process; it
is a blend of art and science that requires an understanding of the system-specific physical
characteristics, hydrology, and management objectives. The guide provides potential rule forms
and examples to inform the development process.
The framework for operations development consists of four steps.
1. The first is to identify long term management objectives, which generally fall into one
of the following categories: hydrologic reliability; cost, financial stability, and
administration; environmental performance; recreation; aesthetics; flood control;
hydropower; and navigation.
2. The second step is to create displays that allow water managers and other stakeholders
to compare alternative operating strategies with regard to one or more management
objectives, called performance measures.
3. Step three is to develop operating rule forms. Potentially effective rule forms are best
informed by the management objectives and system-specific characteristics. Examples
of operating rules in other basins with similar management objectives and/or systemspecific characteristics can provide a starting point.
4. Finally, in step four, rule forms and their parameters are selected by comparing
simulated alternative operations using performance measure displays},

  Abstract                 = {Managing ecosystems with deeply uncertain threshold responses and multiple decision makers poses nontrivial decision
analytical challenges. The problem is imbued with deep uncertainties because decision makers do not know or cannot converge on a
single probability density function for each key parameter, a perfect model structure, or a single adequate objective. The existing
literature on managing multistate ecosystems has generally followed a normative decision-making approach based on expected utility
maximization (MEU). This approach has simple and intuitive axiomatic foundations, but faces at least two limitations. First, a
prespecified utility function is often unable to capture the preferences of diverse decision makers. Second, decision makers’ preferences
depart from MEU in the presence of deep uncertainty. Here, we introduce a framework that allows decision makers to pose multiple
objectives, explore the trade-offs between potentially conflicting preferences of diverse decision makers, and to identify strategies that
are robust to deep uncertainties. The framework, referred to as many-objective robust decision making (MORDM), employs
multiobjective evolutionary search to identify trade-offs between strategies, re-evaluates their performance under deep uncertainty, and
uses interactive visual analytics to support the selection of robust management strategies. We demonstrate MORDM on a stylized
decision problem posed by the management of a lake in which surpassing a pollution threshold causes eutrophication. Our results
illustrate how framing the lake problem in terms of MEU can fail to represent key trade-offs between phosphorus levels in the lake
and expected economic benefits. Moreover, the MEU strategy deteriorates severely in performance for all objectives under deep
uncertainties. Alternatively, the MORDM framework enables the discovery of strategies that balance multiple preferences and perform
well under deep uncertainty. This decision analytic framework allows the decision makers to select strategies with a better understanding
of their expected trade-offs (traditional uncertainty) as well as their robustness (deep uncertainty).},

number of parameters is not clearly defined. Using an information theoretic argument we derive
a measure pD for the effective number of parameters in a model as the difference between
the posterior mean of the deviance and the deviance at the posterior means of the parameters
of interest. In general pD approximately corresponds to the trace of the product of Fisher’s
information and the posterior covariance, which in normal models is the trace of the ‘hat’ matrix
projecting observations onto fitted values. Its properties in exponential families are explored.
The posterior mean deviance is suggested as a Bayesian measure of fit or adequacy, and the
contributions of individual observations to the fit and complexity can give rise to a diagnostic
plot of deviance residuals against leverages. Adding pD to the posterior mean deviance gives
a deviance information criterion for comparing models, which is related to other information
criteria and has an approximate decision theoretic justification. The procedure is illustrated in
some examples, and comparisons are drawn with alternative Bayesian and classical proposals.
Throughout it is emphasized that the quantities required are trivial to compute in a Markov chain
Monte Carlo analysis.},

  Abstract                 = {A multivariate, multisite daily weather generator is presented for use in decision-centric vulnerability assessments under climate change. The tool is envisioned to be useful for a wide range of socioeconomic and biophysical systems sensitive to different aspects of climate variability and change. The proposed stochastic model has several components, including (1) a wavelet decomposition coupled to an autoregressive model to account for structured, low-frequency climate oscillations, (2) a Markov chain and k-nearest-neighbor (KNN) resampling scheme to simulate spatially distributed, multivariate weather variables over a region, and (3) a quantile mapping procedure to enforce long-term distributional shifts in weather variables that result from prescribed climate changes. The Markov chain is used to better represent wet and dry spell statistics, while the KNN bootstrap resampler preserves the covariance structure between the weather variables and across space. The wavelet-based autoregressive model is applied to annual climate over the region and used to modulate the Markov chain and KNN resampling, embedding appropriate low-frequency structure within the daily weather generation process. Parameters can be altered in any of the components of the proposed model to enable the generation of realistic time series of climate variables that exhibit changes to both lower-order and higher-order statistics at long-term (interannual), mid-term (seasonal), and short-term (daily) timescales. The tool can be coupled with impact models in a bottom-up risk assessment to efficiently and exhaustively explore the potential climate changes under which a system is most vulnerable. An application of the weather generator is presented for the Connecticut River basin to demonstrate the tool's ability to generate a wide range of possible climate sequences over an extensive spatial domain.},

This study presents a statistical framework that quantifies and propagates the uncertainties of hydrologic model response through projections of future streamflow under climate change. Different sources of hydrologic model uncertainty are accounted for using Bayesian modeling. The distribution of model residuals is formally characterized to quantify predictive skill, and Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling is used to infer the posterior distributions of both hydrologic and error model parameters. Parameter and residual error uncertainties are integrated to develop reliable prediction intervals for streamflow estimates. The Bayesian hydrologic modeling framework is then extended to a climate change impact assessment. Ensembles of baseline and future climate are downscaled from global circulation models and are used to drive simulations of streamflow over parameters drawn from the posterior space. Time series of streamflow statistics are calculated from baseline and future ensembles of simulated flows. Uncertainties in hydrologic model response, sampling error, and the range of future climate projections are integrated to help determine the level of confidence associated with hydrologic alteration between baseline and future climate regimes. A case study is conducted on the White River in Vermont, USA. Results indicate that the framework can be used to present a reliable depiction of the range of hydrologic alterations that may occur in the future.},

The approach combines regression on physiographic watershed characteristics with a spatial proximity technique that describes the spatial dependence of model parameters. The methodology is tested for the monthly abcd model at a network of gauges in southeast United States and compared against simpler regression and spatial proximity approaches. Unlike other comparative regionalization studies that only evaluate the skill of regionalized streamflow predictions in ungauged catchments, this study also examines the fit between regionalized parameters and their optimal (i.e. calibrated) values. Interestingly, the spatial error model produces parameter estimates that better resemble the optimal parameters than either of the simpler methods, but the spatial proximity method still yields better hydrologic simulations. The analysis suggests that the superior streamflow predictions of spatial proximity result from its ability to better preserve correlations between compensatory hydrological parameters.},

  Abstract                 = {Downscaling precipitation is a difficult challenge for the climate community. We propose and study a new stochastic weather typing approach to perform such a task. In addition to providing accurate small and medium precipitation, our procedure possesses built-in features that allow us to model adequately extreme precipitation distributions. First, we propose a new distribution for local precipitation via a probability mixture model of Gamma and Generalized Pareto (GP) distributions. The latter one stems from Extreme Value Theory (EVT). The performance of this mixture is tested on real and simulated data, and also compared to classical rainfall densities. Then our downscaling method, extending the recently developed nonhomogeneous stochastic weather typing approach, is presented. It can be summarized as a three-step program. First, regional weather precipitation patterns are constructed through a hierarchical ascending clustering method. Second, daily transitions among our precipitation patterns are represented by a nonhomogeneous Markov model influenced by large-scale atmospheric variables like NCEP reanalyses. Third, conditionally on these regional patterns, precipitation occurrence and intensity distributions are modeled as statistical mixtures. Precipitation amplitudes are assumed to follow our mixture of Gamma and GP densities. The proposed downscaling approach is applied to 37 weather stations in Illinois and compared to various possible parameterizations and to a direct modeling. Model selection procedures show that choosing one GP distribution shape parameter per pattern for all stations provides the best rainfall representation amongst all tested models. This work highlights the importance of EVT distributions to improve the modeling and downscaling of local extreme precipitations.},

In this paper, we present an efficient and effective Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampler, entitled the Multiobjective Shuffled Complex Evolution Metropolis (MOSCEM) algorithm, which is capable of solving the multiobjective optimization problem for hydrologic models. MOSCEM is an improvement over the Shuffled Complex Evolution Metropolis (SCEM-UA) global optimization algorithm, using the concept of Pareto dominance (rather than direct single-objective function evaluation) to evolve the initial population of points toward a set of solutions stemming from a stable distribution (Pareto set). The efficacy of the MOSCEM-UA algorithm is compared with the original MOCOM-UA algorithm for three hydrologic modeling case studies of increasing complexity.},

models is insufficient to support the water sector in making future adaptation deci-
5 sions. Furthermore, projections of change in local water resources are wrought with
uncertainties surrounding natural variability, future greenhouse gas emissions, model
structure, population growth and water consumption habits. To analyse the magnitude
of these uncertainties, and their implications for local scale water resource planning,
we present a top-down approach for testing climate change adaptation options us-
10 ing probabilistic climate scenarios and demand projections. An integrated modelling
framework is developed which implements a new, gridded spatial weather generator,
coupled with a rainfall-runoff model and water resource management simulation model.
We use this to provide projections of the number of days, and associated uncertainty
that will require implementation of demand saving measures such as hose pipe bans
15 and drought orders. Results, which are demonstrated for the Thames basin, UK, indicate existing water supplies are sensitive to a changing climate and an increasing
population, and that the frequency of severe demand saving measures are projected
to increase. Considering both climate projections and population growth the median
number of drought order occurrences may increase five-fold. The effectiveness of a
20 range of demand management and supply options have been tested and shown to
provide significant benefits in terms of reducing the number of demand saving days.
We found that increased supply arising from various adaptation options may compensate for increasingly variable flows; however, without reductions in overall demand for
water resources such options will be insufficient on their own to adapt to uncertainties
25 in the projected changes in climate and population. For example, a 30 % reduction in
overall demand by 2050 has a greater impact on reducing the frequency of drought
orders than any of the individual or combinations of supply options; hence a portfolio
of measures are required.},

Inflow is assumed to be impacted by climate fluctuations representing interannual variation (white noise), decadal to multidecadal variability (MDV, here represented by a stochastic autoregressive process) and global change (GC), here represented by a systematic linear trend in seasonal inflow total over the simulation period of 2008--2047. Stochastic (Monte Carlo) simulations are undertaken to explore reservoir performance. In this way, reservoir reliability and risk of extreme persistent water deficit are assessed in the presence of different combinations and magnitudes of GC and MDV. The effectiveness of dynamic management is then explored as a possible climate change adaptation practice, focusing on reservoir performance in the presence of a 20 {\%} downward inflow trend. In these dynamic management experiments, the October-March water allocation each year is adjusted based on seasonal forecasts and updated climate normals. The results illustrate how, in the near-term, MDV can be as significant as GC in impact for this kind of climate-related problem. The results also illustrate how dynamic management can mitigate the impacts. Overall, this type of analysis can deliver guidance on the expected benefits and risks of different management strategies and climate scenarios.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, we review the need for, use of, and demands on climate modeling
to support so-called ‘robust’ decision frameworks, in the context of improving the
contribution of climate information to effective decision making. Such frameworks
seek to identify policy vulnerabilities under deep uncertainty about the future
and propose strategies for minimizing regret in the event of broken assumptions.
We argue that currently there is a severe underutilization of climate models
as tools for supporting decision making, and that this is slowing progress in
developing informed adaptation and mitigation responses to climate change. This
underutilization stems from two root causes, about which there is a growing body
of literature: one, a widespread, but limiting, conception that the usefulness of
climate models in planning begins and ends with regional-scale predictions of
multidecadal climate change; two, the general failure so far to incorporate learning
from the decision and social sciences into climate-related decision support in
key sectors. We further argue that addressing these root causes will require
expanding the conception of climate models; not simply as prediction machines
within ‘predict-then-act’ decision frameworks, but as scenario generators, sources
of insight into complex system behavior, and aids to critical thinking within robust
decision frameworks. Such a shift, however, would have implications for how
users perceive and use information from climate models and, ultimately, the types
of information they will demand from these models—and thus for the types of
simulations and numerical experiments that will have the most value for informing
decision making.},

efficiently explore a range of risk to water supply systems. In both methods, a large ensemble of stochastic weather time series is generated to
simulate the natural variability of the local climate system, and a selected subset of these sequences is used in the impacts assessment. Method
1 selects the subset by first passing the entire ensemble through a rainfall-runoff model and then screening the hydrologic sequences using the
sequent peak algorithm. Method 2 selects a subset of climate sequences based on climate statistics alone, prior to hydrological modeling. Both
methods provide insight for identifying the climate statistics that best relate to the vulnerability of the water system and can be used to reduce
the computational burden of modeling climate variability and change impacts.},

Given concerns about the effects of uncertainty on the outcomes of long-term decisions, many water planners seek adaptation alternatives that are robust given a wide range of possible climate futures. However, there is no
standardized paradigm for quantifying robustness in the water sector. This study uses a new framework for
assessing the impact of future climate change and uncertainty on water supply systems and defines and
demonstrates a new metric for quantifying climate robustness. The metric is based on the range of climate
change space over which an alternative provides acceptable performance. The metric is independent of
assumptions regarding future climate; however, GCM-based (or other) climate projections can be used to
create a ‘‘climate-informed’’ version of the metric. The method is demonstrated for a water supply system in
the northeast United States to evaluate the additional robustness that can be attained through optimal
operational changes, by comparing optimal reservoir operations with current reservoir operations. Results
show the additional robustness gained through adaptation. They also reveal the additional insight regarding robust adaptation gained from the decision-scaling approach that would not be discerned using a GCM projection-based analysis.},

  Abstract                 = {This study tests the performance and uncertainty of calibration strategies for a spatially distributed hydrologic model in order to improve model simulation accuracy and understand prediction uncertainty at interior ungaged sites of a sparsely gaged watershed. The study is conducted using a distributed version of the HYMOD hydrologic model (HYMOD_DS) applied to the Kabul River basin. Several calibration experiments are conducted to understand the benefits and costs associated with different calibration choices, including (1) whether multisite gaged data should be used
simultaneously or in a stepwise manner during model fitting, (2) the effects of increasing parameter complexity, and
(3) the potential to estimate interior watershed flows using only gaged data at the basin outlet. The implications of the
different calibration strategies are considered in the context of hydrologic projections under climate change. To address
the research questions, high-performance computing is utilized to manage the computational burden that results from
high-dimensional optimization problems. Several interesting results emerge from the study. The simultaneous use of multisite data is shown to improve the calibration over a stepwise approach, and both multisite approaches far exceed a calibration based on only the basin outlet. The basin outlet calibration can lead to projections of mid-21st century
streamflow that deviate substantially from projections under multisite calibration strategies, supporting the use of caution
when using distributed models in data-scarce regions for climate change impact assessments. Surprisingly, increased parameter complexity does not substantially increase the uncertainty in streamflow projections, even though parameter equifinality does emerge. The results suggest that increased (excessive) parameter complexity does not always lead to increased predictive uncertainty if structural uncertainties are
present. The largest uncertainty in future streamflow results from variations in projected climate between climate models, which substantially outweighs the calibration uncertainty.},

their constituent station series. Each group of stations is located within a General Circulation Model
grid-box-sized area, and collectively they exhibit a broad range of precipitation climates. The downscaling
procedure is validated using natural climate variability in the observed precipitation records as
an analog for climate change, by alternately considering collections of the driest and wettest seasons as
‘base’ and ‘future’ climates, and comparing the 2 sets of downscaled station parameters to those fit
directly to the respective withheld observations. The resulting downscaled stochastic model parameters
can be readily used for local-scale simulation of climate-change impacts.},

better fits than the more conventional gamma distributions, are convenient for representing the tendency for smaller amounts at
locations near the edges of wet areas. Means, variances, and interstation correlations of monthly precipitation totals are also well
reproduced. In addition, the use of mixed exponential rather than gamma distributions yields interannual variability in the
synthetic series that is much closer to the observed.},

with model calibration suggests that no single-objective function is adequate to measure the ways in which the model fails
to match the important characteristics of the observed data. Given that some of the latest hydrologic models simulate several
of the watershed output fluxes (e.g. water, energy, chemical constituents, etc.), there is a need for effective and efficient multiobjective calibration procedures capable of exploiting all of the useful information about the physical system contained in the
measurement data time series. The MOCOM-UA algorithm, an effective and efficient methodology for solving the multipleobjective global optimization problem, is presented in this paper. The method is an extension of the successful SCE-UA

  Abstract                 = {This paper evaluates the performance of a statistical post-processor for imperfect hydrologic model forecasts. Assuming that the meteorological forecasts are well-calibrated, we employ a "General Linear Model (GLM)" to post-process simulations produced by a hydrologic model. For a particular forecast date, the observations and simulations from an "analysis window" and hydrologic model forecasts for a "forecast window", the GLM Post-Processor (GLMPP) is used to produce an ensemble of predictions of the streamflow observations that will occur during the "forecast window". The objectives of the GLMPP are to: (1) preserve any skill in the original hydrologic ensemble forecast; (2) correct systematic model biases; (3) retain the equal-likelihood assumption for the ensemble; (4) preserve temporal scale dependency relationships in streamflow hydrographs and the uncertainty in the predictions; and, (5) produce reliable ensemble predictions. 
Observed and simulated daily streamflow data from the Second Workshop on Model Parameter Estimation Experiment (MOPEX) are used to test how well these objectives are met when the GLMPP is applied to ensemble hydrologic forecasts driven by well calibrated meteorological forecasts. A 39-year hydrologic dataset from the French Broad basin is split into calibration and verification periods. The results show that the GLMPP built using data from the calibration period removes the mean bias when applied to hydrologic model simulations from both the calibration and verification periods. Probability distributions of the post-processed model simulations are shown to be closer to the climatological probability distributions of observed streamflow than the distributions of the unadjusted simulated flows. A number of experiments with different GLMPP configurations were also conducted to examine the effects of different configurations for forecast and analysis window lengths on the robustness of the results.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, we provide a systematic comparison of various evolutionary approaches to
multiobjective optimization using six carefully chosen test functions. Each test function
involves a particular feature that is known to cause difficulty in the evolutionary optimization
process, mainly in converging to the Pareto-optimal front (e.g., multimodality and
deception). By investigating these different problem features separately, it is possible to
predict the kind of problems to which a certain technique is or is not well suited. However,
in contrast to what was suspected beforehand, the experimental results indicate a hierarchy
of the algorithms under consideration. Furthermore, the emerging effects are evidence
that the suggested test functions provide sufficient complexity to compare multiobjective
optimizers. Finally, elitism is shown to be an important factor for improving evolutionary
multiobjective search.},

  Abstract                 = {The ensemble Kalman filter (EnFK) has recently become one of the
most popular methods for high dimensional data assimilation and it is widely
used in many disciplines such as discretization of partial differential equations in
geophysics or image reconstruction. The EnKF has been originally proposed as
a Monte Carlo approximation to the extended Kalman filter, which is in practice
inapplicable when dimension of the input data is huge.
Numerous publications have studied applications and asymptotic results of the
EnKF, while properties of the Kalman filter (KF) and EnKF for the infinite
dimensional Hilbert spaces are still under the development.
The main purpose of this paper is a brief description of the high dimensional EnKF
with references to the most valuable publications. Also, a short introduction to
problems related with KF and EnKF on infinite dimensional Hilbert spaces is
included.},
